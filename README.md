# üíº My Portfolio ‚Äì Full Stack Developer Showcase

This is my personal portfolio web application built using **React.js (frontend)** and **Express.js + MongoDB (backend)**. It showcases my skills, projects, and experience in modern web development through a clean and animated user interface. Visitors can explore project cards and view detailed information through a dynamic, route-aware layout.

The application also includes a secure **Admin Panel** with functionality to add new projects, making the content fully manageable through protected routes and JWT-based authentication.
